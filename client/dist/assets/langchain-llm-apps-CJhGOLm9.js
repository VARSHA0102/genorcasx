const n=`<h1 align="center">LangChain -- Unleash the Magic of AI</h1>\r
\r
Today, with the fast-evolving world of Artificial Intelligence (AI),\r
Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI (GenAI), it has become\r
more important for professionals and enthusiasts to know what all can be\r
done with the tools in this space. Out of these, LangChain is a\r
prominent and well-architected framework for GenAI application\r
development- thus making it a coveted asset in the up-to-date AI job\r
industry. This chat comes sans the theory-wallah aspect of Natural\r
Language Processing (NLP) and instead takes a practical, engineering\r
directed spin.\r
\r
Companies are on the lookout for skills in Prompt Engineering, LLMs,\r
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vector\r
Databases, as much as they do for machine learning, deep learning,\r
programming and domain-specific knowledge such as computer vision and\r
NLP. Luckily, these GenAI skills can be gotten and implemented rather\r
easily if we build on a strong base in machine learning. So here we go\r
off on this fun-filled adventure exploring these tools and their\r
implications.\r
\r
What if you had a spark of magic that could turn a simple AI into a\r
genius companion---one that flips through vast libraries in seconds,\r
recalls every word you've shared, and wields tools to solve real-world\r
puzzles?Let's see how this dazzling toolkit is your wand for weaving\r
intelligence into action?\r
\r
## **What is LangChain?**\r
\r
LangChain is an open-source framework launched in October 2022 by\r
Harrison Chase which turns large language models into tools that can be\r
utilized to create intelligent applications. Rather than merely basic\r
conversations, which could imply everything from dynamic chatbots to\r
intelligent research assistants to entirely new products, this newly\r
enables AI to be connected with external data, tools, and memory.\r
\r
LangChain, developed for the most part in Python but with a JavaScript\r
version to reach a wider audience, has successfully simplified the\r
production of complex AI capabilities by using 'snappable' modules that\r
may be pieced together like a jigsaw. Since its introduction, a vibrant\r
global community has enhanced the software with features like LangSmith,\r
for debugging, and LangServe, for deployment. As of August 2025,\r
LangChain has powered several ventures from nascent start-ups to\r
established research laboratories, rendering the development of AI\r
accessible, innovative, and enjoyable to all classes of programmers.\r
\r
## **Langchain Ecosystem**\r
\r
In addition to its core framework, the LangChain ecosystem incorporates\r
several powerful tools designed to work together through APIs to provide\r
an all-encompassing solution for creating, debugging, and deploying AI\r
applications. Some of the most important components are:\r
\r
**Langsmith**\r
\r
Langsmith is a toolkit for debugging, monitoring, and assessing LLM\r
application performance. LangSmith gives you the visibility into how\r
chains and agents use tokens, latency, and response accuracy. It is\r
crucial when you are tuning complicated flows and detecting problems in\r
production.\r
\r
**Langraph**\r
\r
Langraph is a library for writing stateful, graph-based workflows with\r
LLMs. With LangGraph, you can handle multi-stage agent systems\r
accustomed orchestrating jobs and robust applications requiring dynamic\r
judgments and state.\r
\r
**Langserve**\r
\r
Langserve is a utility for deploying LangChain applications as APIs,\r
allowing you to integrate your AI app into web services or production\r
easily. It streamlines the process of scaling your AI app to serve end\r
users.\r
\r
These tools collectively enhance LangChain's flexibility, making it a\r
robust choice for both development and deployment of AI applications.\r
\r
## **Comparison of Langchain with Heystack , LlamaIndex & CamelAI**\r
\r
**HeyStack**\r
\r
Deepset's Haystack is another open-source framework designed to create\r
scalable RAG pipelines for search systems and QA systems. The primary\r
targets of this toolkit are modularity and efficiency, which are of\r
great help when developing applications with high-quality information\r
retrieval.\r
\r
**Comparison with Langchain**\r
\r
Haystack is a higher performer when it comes to RAG and search\r
applications. It is easy to use and is faster than LangChain. At the\r
same time, it is less versatile compared to LangChain because of the\r
limitation to solely agent-based or multi-tool workflows. LangChain is\r
recommended in case of more complex and interacting use-cases, whereas\r
Haystack is ideal for the most straightforward retrieval.\r
\r
**LlamaIndex**\r
\r
LlamaIndex is formerly known as GPT Index ,which is a specialized\r
framework for efficient data indexing and retrieval, which adds\r
context-augmented features to LLMs. It has demonstrated to be especially\r
useful in converting vast datasets into queryable forms for RAG\r
applications.\r
\r
**Comparison with Langchain**\r
\r
LlamaIndex is more dedicated to data indexing and retrieval and is\r
therefore a lighter, more straightforward option suitable for RAG\r
applications with a search focus. In contrast, LangChain is suitable for\r
more complex workflows, agents, and integrations obtained due to a\r
greater degree of freedom. In many situations, developers use LlamaIndex\r
for retrieval in combination with LangChain as orchestration to obtain\r
desirable results.\r
\r
**CamelAI**\r
\r
CamelAI often written as CAMEL-AI is a novel framework that targets\r
multi-agent systems, empowering LLMs to work as independent agents to\r
complete challenging activities. This workflow is less proven than\r
LangChain. Haystack, and LlamaIndex.\r
\r
**Comparison with Langchain**\r
\r
CamelAI is unique because of its focus on multi-agent collaboration but\r
less versatile. LangChain is designed to work with a wider number of\r
applications, such as RAG, memory, and tool integration. Given\r
LangChain's ecosystem's maturity and broad functional capabilities, it\r
is more appropriate for production-ready applications. At the same time,\r
CamelAI is better suited for sporadic experiments in the development of\r
agents.\r
\r
## **Installation dependencies**\r
\`\`\`bash\r
pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-community faiss-cpu\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
Set your OpenAI API key:\r
\r
-   Unix/macOS: export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\r
\r
-   Windows: set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\r
\r
Replace your_api_key_here with your actual key. Run each with python\r
[[filename.py]{.underline}](http://filename.py)\r
\r
## **LangChain Components**\r
\r
LangChain's magic is in its simple, interconnected pieces which come\r
together to make AI apps that are simultaneously very powerful and very\r
easy to build. Here is a more in-depth look at each piece, what it does\r
in the AI app, and how it is used in the real world:\r
\r
-   **Models:** This is the brainy bit. In real life, it is typically an\r
    > LLM such as GPT-4, which processes and generates text. From\r
    > answering questions to writing stories, they are the base of your\r
    > app's intelligence.\r
\r
> **How it works**: This is the AI's thinking brain. A lot of the time,\r
> it will out-think you creatively when you are asking a question.\r
>\r
> *File*: langchain_model.py\r
\r
\`\`\`python\r
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\r
\r
# Set up the AI brain\r
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.5)\r
\r
# Ask something fun\r
response = model.invoke("What's a cool thing AI can do?")\r
\r
print(response.content)\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
-   **Prompt Templates:** These are structured guides that help you\r
    > shape how you ask questions. They ensure you give clear,\r
    > repeatable instructions which are like recipes for consistent AI\r
    > making them perfect for tasks like generating branded content, and\r
    > standardizing queries for data analysis.\r
\r
> **How it works**: This shapes questions to get consistent, fun\r
> responses from the AI.\r
>\r
> *File:* langchain_prompt.py\r
\r
\`\`\`python\r
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\r
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\r
\r
# Set up the AI\r
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.5)\r
\r
# Create a question guide\r
template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Make a fun name for a {thing}.")\r
prompt = template.format(thing="pet robot")\r
\r
response = model.invoke(prompt)\r
print(response.content)\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
\r
-   **Chains:** Involving more dissimilar kinds of projects successively.\r
    > For instance, "summarizing a document" creates a summary of it.\r
    > Then you might need "finding the key points." Chaining a text\r
    > summary with a sentiment analysis might be helpful for customer\r
    > feedback systems.\r
\r
> **How it works**: Task. The previous step's response is linked to the\r
> following step for more thorough insight.\r
>\r
> *File:* langchain_chain.py\r
\r
 \`\`\`python\r
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\r
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\r
from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SequentialChain\r
\r
# Set up the AI\r
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.5)\r
\r
# Step 1: Summarize\r
summary_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize this: {text}")\r
summary_chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=summary_prompt, output_key="summary")\r
\r
# Step 2: Find main idea\r
main_idea_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("What's the main idea of {summary}?")\r
main_idea_chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=main_idea_prompt, output_key="main_idea")\r
\r
# Link steps\r
seq_chain = SequentialChain(\r
    chains=[summary_chain, main_idea_chain],\r
    input_variables=["text"],\r
    output_variables=["main_idea"]\r
)\r
\r
# Run it\r
text = "This toolkit makes AI apps by linking models with tools and data."\r
response = seq_chain({"text": text})\r
print(response["main_idea"])\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
-   **Memory:** Memory saves the history of a chat or a context that\r
    > allows the application to be more talkative and more attentive. It\r
    > is best used for chatbots, which must save the user's preferences\r
    > or multi-step. Example: Virtual Assistant for booking a resort at\r
    > a hotel for a week.\r
\r
> **How it works**: Save the chat history, so the AI remembers\r
> everything and talks like a friend.\r
>\r
> *File*: langchain_memory.py\r
\r
 \`\`\`python\r
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\r
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\r
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain\r
\r
# Set up the AI\r
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.5)\r
\r
# Add a memory notebook\r
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()\r
\r
# Create a chat\r
chat = ConversationChain(llm=model, memory=memory)\r
\r
# Talk to the AI\r
print(chat.run("I love starry nights."))\r
print(chat.run("What do I love?"))\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
-   **Vector Stores:** These are smart databases that convert any text\r
    > to numerical codes known as embeddings. They make searches faster\r
    > as they work the best in applications like knowledge bases. With a\r
    > vast set of documents, such as research papers or company\r
    > policies, you want to find an answer for a question quickly.\r
\r
> **How it works**: Vector stores convert text to a code that can be\r
> easily searched, just as a very fast library search.\r
>\r
> *File*: langchain_vectorstore.py\r
\r
 \`\`\`python\r
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\r
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\r
from langchain.docstore.document import Document\r
\r
# Sample text\r
text = "This toolkit builds smart AI apps easily."\r
documents = [Document(page_content=text)]\r
\r
# Store as searchable vector codes\r
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\r
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)\r
\r
# Search it\r
results = vector_store.similarity_search("What does this toolkit do?", k=1)\r
print(results[0].page_content)\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
-   **Agents:** These are intelligent tools and decision-makers for\r
    > selecting and using the tools. For example, calculators perform\r
    > standard calculations and web searches browse for information.\r
    > Agents are ideal for dynamic tasks, such as a trip planner that\r
    > gets weather forecasts and budget advice.\r
\r
> **How it works**: The agent asks the user's or another tool's\r
> questions to select the best tool to perform each task. The agent\r
> combines questions for overall purposes.\r
>\r
> *File*: langchain_agent.py\r
\`\`\`python\r
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\r
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool\r
from langchain.tools import BaseTool\r
\r
# Fun tool: Mock fact finder\r
class FunFactTool(BaseTool):\r
    name = "fun_fact"\r
    description = "Finds a fun fact about a topic"\r
\r
    def _run(self, query: str) -> str:\r
        return f"Fun fact about {query}: It's super cool!"\r
\r
    def _arun(self, query: str):\r
        raise NotImplementedError("Async not supported")\r
\r
# Set up AI and agent\r
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.5)\r
tools = [FunFactTool()]\r
agent = initialize_agent(tools, model, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)\r
\r
# Ask the agent\r
response = agent.run("Tell me a fun fact about dogs.")\r
print(response)\r
